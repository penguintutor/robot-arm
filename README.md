GUI application for a USB robot arm

Work in progress
================

This is an early availability release. The software is still work in progress and this document mentions features that are not yet implemented. 


Introduction
============

Gooey Robot Arm is a GUI application to control the Maplin Robot Arm. This is designed for use with the Raspberry Pi running Linux, but should work with any Linux computer. It should work with Windows as well, but setup may be a bit tricky on Windows.

The robot arm is also available through other retailers, often called an Education Robot Arm or similar, although they sometimes come with a handheld remote control rather than the USB interface. The robot arm needs the USB interface which can be purchased separately if it was not already included.

The usb robot arm comes with Windows software only. This software has been written to control the arm from other computers in particular the Raspberry Pi educational computer with the Linux operating system. This software is provided free of charge under the GPL version 3 license which allows you to view and edit the source code and redistribute as along as you make any changes available as open source software through the same license.

The application is similar to, but not the same as the Windows software. This application is written using a similar layout and key bindings to the Windows software, but uses a single application window to handle the realtime control as well as record and playback functionality (not yet included).

This page provides some of the information for developers wanting to understand the software. If you just want to set the software up and run it then see the user documentation.

The code is well documented within the code, but this explains some of the high-level information and reasons for why some of the things are delivered as they are.


Install
=======

The instructions are provided for Linux only. The application has not been tested on other operating systems and is unlikely to be until much later in the development. The program uses Python which is currently available in two main versions: version 2.* and version 3.* (referred to as Python 2 and Python 3). I normally create new projects for Python 3 however depending upon the actual distribution at the moment the install for Python 3 can be significantly harder. Therefore instructions for Python 2 are provided first.

The pre-requisites for the applicaiton are: pygame, libusb and pyusb, but these then also have their own dependancies (particularly pygame for Python 3).

These instructions are for Debian (or Ubuntu) based distributions the commands may be different for other distributions.

The first two can be installed using (this does not setup pygame for Python 3 though).

sudo apt-get install python-pygame libusb-1.0-0


pyusb can be installed manually.

First download using:

wget https://github.com/walac/pyusb/tarball/master -O walac-pyusb.tar.gz


unzip and cd to the directory 
(actual file and directory names depend upon the latest version of pyusb) 

tar -xvzf walac-pyusb.tar.gz
cd walac-pyusb-*

sudo python setup.py install
(or for Python 3)
sudo python3 setup.py install


Python 3 pygame

Whilst pygame will work on Python 3 it is not necessarily available through the distributions repositories. These instructions explain how to install it manually.
This uses the current development version as at the time of writing the official release is 1.9.1 which will not work with Python 3.

Install the pre-requisites using:
sudo apt-get install python3-dev mercurial libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsmpeg-dev libportmidi-dev libswscale-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libfreetype6-dev libjpeg-dev 

Download pygame using:

hg clone https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame

cd pygame

python3 setup.py build
sudo python3 setup.py install




Programming style
=================

This has been written using Pygame. This is the first application I've written in Pygame and whilst Pygame and the programming method have provided flexibilty to create a friendly looking application, it did add some challenges in that certain functionality that is normally included by toolkits needed to be handled by my code. 

I have avoided using object oriented programming for the GUI application influenced by Al Sweigart's book Making Games with Python & Pygame (see acknowledgments). This does make it easier to follow for new programmers that may struggle to grasp the object oriented concepts (it took me some time to grasp the paradigm when I first started OO programming). The downside is that to make it easier to follow I have had to create more global variables than I would normally like to. Many of these are variables that don't change "much". Technically they are not constants as they are updated, especially during the setup stage, but when treated as though they are constants by other functions then it is safe to treat them as though they were constants. I have created them using CAPITAL letters which convention states is normally only used for true constants. This is cheating, but hopefully cheating for the right reason. 

Whilst the idea of avoiding object oriented programming is a good idea when teaching programming, for a larger application this can make the code more complex. I have therefore refactored some of the code to use some object orientation and may looking at further rectoring to improve the code..



Window layout
=============

The window layout is designed for a fixed screen size of 800 x 600 pixels.
Some of the placement is created dynamically during the startup to allow the different blocks to be positioned and spaced differently, but that would need significant additional code to handle dynamic resizing of the screen. Whilst some of the code is written so as to make changing this to dynamic window sizing easier, it is not planned to change it to a dyanmic window size at this time.



Button lists (dictionaries)
===========================

The buttons are contained in a dictionary of dictionaries. 
This allows us to iterate over the buttons when drawing them and for checking for key press / mouse click. 

The key 'type' is used to determine how the buttons are handled (eg. are they 'movement' buttons)


Button images
=============

Each button has 3 images -normal -pressed and -hover
-pressed is a lighter version of -normal
-hover is the same as -normal (possible change in future) - or hover may be done using different colour for the text


Buttons can have an 'icon' applied which should be the same size as the button using transparency to see the button underneath.

Buttons can also have text applied - 'text' = centered vertically OR 'text1' = line 1, 'text2' = line 2 


Key presses
===========

Most sofware uses either the get_pressed function OR the event.type KEYUP/KEYDOWN for detecting key presses. Due to the behaviour of the different buttons this application uses both. This is so that normal application buttons and the Light button can use traditional button / key press techniques, but the movement buttons instead perform an action whilst a key is in the pressed state. This could have been done by tracking the state of each key, but is easier using the different techniques for each of the different button types.  

The code checks for the value of type. If it is 'movement' in then we use get_pressed . For the other buttons the event handling is written separately for each button in the loop code.


Message popup
=============

Window in centre of screen with OK button
It can have links to urls - which are encoded using BB-code eg.
[url=http://website.com]linkname[/url] or [url]http://website.com[/url]
only one link per line - and link is applied to the entire line

This should be used with just the url on that line eg. 

Line 1: See below for more information
Line 2: [url=http://www.penguintutor.com]www.penguintutor.com[/url]



Todo / Future development
=========================

At the moment only real-time operation of the robot arm is included. In future I hope to add record and playback functionality.

Hover doesn't do anything yet (perhaps add tooltips).



Acnowledgements
===============

Although this program is my own work acknowledgements go to the following people whose resources I have used to assist in the creating of this program. 

Al Sweigart for the great books on Invent with Python http://inventwithpython.com/ which has been a great help with learning Pygame and influential in some of the techniques used.

Peter Lavelle whose MagPi article (issue 14) http://www.themagpi.com/en/issue/14 helped with the initial setup of the robot arm and usb modules and Jamie Scott whose WikiHow article http://www.wikihow.com/Use-a-USB-Robotic-Arm-with-a-Raspberry-Pi-%28Maplin%29 provided 
the instructions required to communicate with the robot arm.
